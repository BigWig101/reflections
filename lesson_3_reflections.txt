When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local? - We could use a remote repository when we would want to collaborate with someone or a group of people and work on it together.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository? - In case there is an auto update feature in the github, we might have  the broken code (in case of a broken code) in our local repository. So in order to avoid that we can manually pull changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another? - Branch - when we want to make a new change to our repository but want to original, working version to stay intact. Clone - to work on a repo locally. Fork - to make changes to a repo on GitHub which isnt accessible to us.
