When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local? - We could use a remote repository when we would want to collaborate with someone or a group of people and work on it together.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository? - In case there is an auto update feature in the github, we might have  the broken code (in case of a broken code) in our local repository. So in order to avoid that we can manually pull changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another? - Branch - when we want to make a new change to our repository but want to original, working version to stay intact. Clone - to work on a repo locally. Fork - to make changes to a repo on GitHub which isnt accessible to us.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally? - In case we would go offline, we can have the changes stored locally and not merged into our own working branch. And once our works done we would be in a position to merge the remote with our local master branch.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder? - For collaboration we could use GoogleDocs, DropBox, MS Office suites but they arent much code or developer friendly in the sense that they dont allow you to view detailed changes made by specific users and confirming before each change is merged into the main code, which isnt possible in the cases other thsn git or github.
