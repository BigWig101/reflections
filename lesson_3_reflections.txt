When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local? - We could use a remote repository when we would want to collaborate with someone or a group of people and work on it together.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository? - In case there is an auto update feature in the github, we might have  the broken code (in case of a broken code) in our local repository. So in order to avoid that we can manually pull changes.
